# üçÇ Hacktoberfest

Welcome to Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open source contributions! At AppFlowy, we're excited to be part of this global event, and we invite you to join us in making a positive impact on our project.

### What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is an annual event that encourages individuals to dive into the world of open source software development. It's an excellent opportunity for developers, both beginners and veterans, to contribute to meaningful projects, improve their skills, and connect with the open source community.

Here's how it works:

* **Duration**: Hacktoberfest runs throughout the month of October.
* **Goal**: Participants are encouraged to make at least four pull requests (PRs) to open source repositories on platforms like GitHub.
* **Rewards**: Complete the challenge, and you'll receive a limited-edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt (provided you meet the participation criteria).
