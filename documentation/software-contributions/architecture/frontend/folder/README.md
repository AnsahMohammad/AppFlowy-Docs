# Folder

### Definitions

AppFlowy uses `workspace`,`app`,`view` to organize user data. These concepts are used in the frontend and backend.

As you see in the below picture, A `workspace` represent as the user root folder. The `workspace` contains a list of apps. The`app` represents as the sub-folder. It can be nested into another sub-folder. Currently, AppFlowy only supports one layer document structure. A `app` contains a list of `view`s.
